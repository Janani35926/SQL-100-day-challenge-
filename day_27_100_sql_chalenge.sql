-- Day 27/100 Days SQL Challenge


-- You are working with a table called orders that tracks customer orders with their order dates and amounts. 

-- Write a query to find each customerâ€™s latest order amount
-- along with the amount of the second latest order. 

-- Your output should be like 
-- customer_id, lastest_order_amount, second_lastest_order_amount
